#### Load the dplyr library.
#### Load the tidyr library.
##1.Read the dataset and stored in the data frame format.
#### features: List of all features.
#### activity_labels: Links the class labels with their activity name.
#### X_train: Training set.
#### y_train: Training labels.
#### X_test: Test set.
#### y_test: Test labels.
#### subject_train: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
#### subject_test: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
####The data into a suitable for "dplyr" library data frame format.
##2.Naming the columns of data.
##3.Remove duplicate column.
####Transfer X_test to remove duplicate rows, then transpose.(removing the X_test duplicate column)
####Transfer X_train to remove duplicate rows, then transpose.
##4.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
####Select test set column containing “mean()” into X_test_std.
####Select test set column containing “std()” into X_test_std.
####Combined subject_test, y_test, X_test_mean X_test_std to as test_set according to column.
####Delete X_test_mean and X_test_std.
####Select train set column containing “mean()” into X_train_std.
####Select train set column containing “std()” into X_train_std.
####Combined subject_train, y_train, X_train_mean X_train_std to as train_set according to column.
####Delete X_train_mean and X_train_std.
####Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
####Merging test_set and train_set to create one data set called data_set in rows.
#### sort data_set in the order of the subject,the same subject value in the order of activity_labels.
##5.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
####Merging data_set and activity_labels in the same column name.(the same column name is activity_labels)
####Delete activity_labels columns of data_set.
##6.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (tidy the data)
####Delete "()" in the data_set column names.
####Delete "-mean" in the data_set column names.
####Replace "-" to "_" in the data_set column names.
####The data_set from tBodyAcc_X to fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag column,the column names as the values of the signals,the values as the values of the mean,duplicating all other columns as needed.
####Delete "_std" in the data_set column names.
####The data_set from tBodyAcc_X to fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag column,the column names as the values of the signals,the values as the values of the std,duplicating all other columns as needed.
####Delete the fifth column of data_set.(remove duplicate the signals)
##7.creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
####Group data_set by the Column of the subject, activities and the signals,the results in data_set_groups.
####Each group for the average of the mean and STD, and deposited in the data_set_tidy.
##8.The data_set_tidy output to a text file called data_set_tidy.txt.
